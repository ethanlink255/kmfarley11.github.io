			As a Computer Engineering student from the University of Cincinnati 
			I have a passion for everything in the computing field. <br> <br>
			From programming a web app to wiring up electrical components of an arduino
			my interest in logic and the physicality of electricity consumes me in and out of the classroom. <br> <br>
			Most of my experience to date has been directed towards software; however, my interest in
			hardware is just as resonant. This page is the largest one and hopefully, will allow you to get
			a decent understanding of who I am, what I have done, and what I am all about </br> <br>
			This site has been created and maintained by myself. To see my resume(s) there are links 
			above and below for your viewing or saving pleasure.
